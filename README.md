A thesis project madness :)

My first RoR app, developed while learning Ruby on Rails (as a personal challenge) for the first time (in a month and a half) time cruch for my final thesis project.

No! this is not a Dribble clone, the real magic happens on the dashboard once you upload a project.

The app purpose is to "inspire" the user by giving them live feedback based on the project their working on, basically wiretapping into the creative process.
You know how you have this new project, open google to get related ideas or information? Well the app does all of this for you based on an image you upload to it, it could be work in progress or just a scketch, give it some tags and you are on your way :)
